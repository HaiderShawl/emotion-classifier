# emotion-classifier
A ML classifier which classifies images based on different emotions (happy, sad, disgust, surprise, neutral).
Analyzes frames from video or web cam and predicts an emotion if a face is detected.

The emotion classifier has an accuracy of about 67%, but the performance is quite poor. Currently working on improving this performace.
